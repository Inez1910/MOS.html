			<div class="p1">
				<p>Some say that now is the time. That today in our country, women now have a platform to tell the stories of their bodies. Riding on the momentum of the #MeToo movement, now is the time, finally, for women (this includes trans- and non-binary) to talk about the cages their bodies have been stuffed into, or the torture their bodies and psyches have had to survive, and even persist through. But, that statement risks overshadowing the fact that these stories did not just suddenly become relevant. They have <em>always</em> been relevant. What has changed is that there is now a willingness to listen to these stories, a willingness that has hardly been present until now. I am certain the stories we tell young minds hold the greatest potential for future change. Therefore, by telling my story to my sons, I find courage for the future.</p>
