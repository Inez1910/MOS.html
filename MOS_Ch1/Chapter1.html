			<p>	Watching him plug the toaster in, I listened as the lips of my thirteen-year-old son—lips that, not long ago, were shaped like a perfect tiny bell, suckling for nourishment—uttered a word I had taken for granted in childhood household.<br><br>
			“No, Mom.  All girls are slu....ts...uhh...” “Sorry mom,” he grimaced, after catching the look on my face.<br>
			“Well...uhh, let’s talk about this, shall we?” I suggest.<br><br>
		</div>
		<div class="p2">
			My mouth closes, my sight drops to the floor, and my shoulders stiffen under the tension in the air.<br>
			Panicking, not sure if my ears deceived me, I sink down the abyss of my white matter, struggling to grasp any synaptic root, to safely tether myself to reality.  Images of my son as a toddler reached out to me as I sank further.  A sturdy memory of when he learned to bounce in his springy seat flashes by.  His mucous-covered toothless grin locking onto my signal, as he joyfully assesses my coos.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p3">
			But, I was too late.  It was as if I missed the root by millimeters (or maybe it’s milliseconds).  I’m freefalling now, down through the levels of my being.  It’s as if I am watching the stories of a skyscraper flash by, until finally crashing into my childhood.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p4">
			Stephie was the sweetly truncated version of my paternally-inspired birth name. Yet, as a small child, my photos were virtually color-print versions of my mother’s black and white childhood photos. And so, even though I was named after my father, “lil’ Gigi” was what I was often called instead—paired with “Figlia bella!” and loving cheek squeezes at annual family picnics.  I took comfort in this pet name, knowing somehow it was an honor to be a “beautiful daughter” of such a beautiful mother.  In my eyes, she was radiant, like some sort of warm magic.  She stunned me into adulation, as I watched her confidently hold intelligent conversations with others, after spending hours grooming, adorning, and worshipping her body in front of her bathroom mirror.  There were times, however, where I gazed curiously at her as she debated some mysterious issue with the clerk in the check-out lines of our local grocers.  Sometimes, that curiosity morphed into fear, on the nights she screamed at my father.  Those were no longer coherent conversations.  Those were wars that kept my sister and I huddled together, anchored on the floor of the hallway.  And yet, while I couldn’t understand the reason for her anger then, I was drawn to it, like a June bug to a glowing summer porch light.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p5">
			This curiosity lingered as I grew.  With wild locks partially tamed into pig tails, Rainbow Bright doll in tow, and oversized white stockings under a purple corduroy dress (thank you ‘80’s fashion sense), I was fascinated by sensual input from my outside world.  It was especially funny when I learned to make strange flatulating sounds by pressing my mouth firmly against my forearm and blowing with all my might.  “Tsk! That’s unbecoming of a lady!” my grandpa would say sternly, while simultaneously stifling back a discreet chuckle.<br>  
			While I saw my mother as a goddess then, I still frequently looked up to men.  There’s my comically stern engineer grandfather, my overly affectionate veteran papa, and my popularly charismatic electrician father.  The roles they, and other men, often played appeared fun and powerful.  Regardless, I was happy as a female, proud to look like my mom.  Besides, penises were so goofy to me then.<br> 
		</div>
		<div class="p6"> 
			My brother, sister, and I were playing hide-and-seek one evening when my parents attended a holiday party.  At one point, after my sister and I found my brother hiding in the shower, we turned the shower on, as we howled with the deep belly-laughs of children.  By chance, I spotted his goofy-looking penis through his wet underwear and proceeded to point and laugh. <br>
		</div>
		<div class="p7">
			No, I never wanted to actually be the men I looked up to.  Penises seemed too obtrusive.  Instead, I was content in my physical re-manifestation of my mother. <br>
		</div>
		<div class="p8">
			In an effort to accommodate this dualism, I turn to daydreams. I imagine myself as a strong woman acting out the same wild, carefree, violently courageous roles I observe men acting out on our swivel-box color T.V.  I want to be Keanu Reeves jumping from high-speed buses rigged to explode, or Sean Connery as a debonair secret agent driving fancy fast cars and playing with state-of-the-art gadgets of destruction, or Bruce Lee kicking Chuck Norris’ ass (Yeah!).<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p9">
			Regardless of the framed photos placed throughout my childhood home, I would still daydream about the world of men.  I notice Linda Hamilton as the bad-ass crazy hero-mom, and Sigourney Weaver as a futuristic space hero, and surrogate mother.  But, well, their characters are still motherly.  I want to play hard, or be taken seriously, like men, no explanations required.  No mouths to feed, no asses to wipe.  Besides, this is not what I see in my mother.  She’s a working woman, in a man’s world.   <br>
		</div>
		<div class="p10">
			My fascination with the man’s world continues as I develop pubic hair, squishy sore breasts, monthly bleeding spells, and intense mood swings.  Not to mention, ovaries seem way overrated.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p11">
			At fourteen, for example, in the eighth grade, I usually looked forward to “Free-Dress Fridays,” when we’re not bound to the dull uniforms of the stuffy Catholic school I felt forced to attend.  Clad in my favorite pair of beige khaki pants, and a shirt I no longer remember, fifteen minutes go by as peers quietly chortle and conspicuously gravitate behind me in line before a friend pulls me aside.  After she politely informs me of the massive red stain on my ass, I realize I have now entered the murky and mysterious world of womanhood. <br> 
		</div>
		<div class="p12">
			Bleeding sucks—and khakis, too.  In fact, my transformation into womanhood only intensifies my longing to jump from fast vehicles, round-house kick mortal enemies, impressively wield handguns, or even be the leader of an intensely visceral Hollywood sex scene.  Dirty Dancing plays on repeat in my dreams, as my breasts swell and nerve clusters spark at the slightest touch.  Farthest from the prosaic roles—of Adam on top, dominating Eve—in the porn my father watched while he thought I was sleeping, I imagined myself in full control.  The lovers of my dreams were begging for my mercy, as I decided when they could be released. <br>
		</div>
		<div class="p13">
			I thoroughly enjoy fourteen, the first year of my metamorphosis.  But, I could never fully share this excitement with friends.  Somehow, I knew this was unbecoming of girls to discuss such topics, apart from the awkward bleeding and various pains of puberty.  Oh, and farts!  Girls didn’t fart then.<br> 
		</div>
		<div class="p14">
			Days and weeks fly by while exploring my imagination and body.  At this point, too, the dogma my conveniently-Catholic mother immersed us in from birth no longer makes any sense.  Despite being dropped off at catechism most Sundays (maybe they went shopping?) or receiving holy communion or being placed into fancy Catholic schools after fighting at the local public school (I still say that other girl threw the first punch), something did not sit right with me.  Why couldn’t He be She, or even It?  Couldn’t God be Goddess, or simply It?  Didn’t I come from my beautiful mother?  While I certainly saw the appeal of a man’s many awesome roles, my mother was the closest thing to a god I ever knew.  I came from her body, so what was so wrong with this?  Why couldn’t God’s true form to be complete in two Xs, like the manifestation of my radiantly beautiful and wise Sicilian mother? <br>	
		</div>
		<div class="p15">
			These ideas continue to inspire me, as I launch my adolescent rebellion.  I riot against the rickety phallocentric system of yore, like a trafficked human passing through the shadow markets, impulsively struggling, reflexively jerking against my shackles.<br> 
		</div>
		<div class="p16">
			Fascinated by my powers to mentally rouse Her—my inner source of energy—I would often enjoy self-stimulation.  Weeks before my fifteenth birthday, I gave myself the best present ever.  I beam with excitement as I finally experience my first orgasm.  From nothing more than my imagination, I instinctively pump my hips, quietly moaning into my pillow, shivers shooting up and down my spine as I lay in bed.  I never want it to end.  But, outside the safety of my room, I know this is like farts.<br> 
		</div>
		<div class="p17">  
			It wasn’t so much pride I felt, but a sense of wholeness—some may call it a sense of oneness.  I was warm and cushioned by weightlessness, drifting off to some other dimension.  I imagined what it would be like to be with certain celebrities, peers, or random handsome people.  Laying on my twin bed, the four walls of my space completely cluttered in magazine pages of massive Mavericks’ breaks—and those that dared to ride them—or mountains of powder with specks of snowboarders posing in the sky above, listening as Lauryn Hill told me about how her pain was strummed with “his” fingers, or Gwen Stefani as she raged about being “just a girl.”<br> 
		</div>
		<div class="p18">
			Within seconds I would be lost in my own mental wonderscape, setting up a scene, assigning roles, adjusting the ambience... and, there it was, like a springy diving board, inviting me to jump into my primordial waters, to explore my source.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p19">
			My imagination would take me all over the multiverse, in and out of space and time, across the globe and the full spectrum of human emotion.  Yet, there were corners She kept hidden.  Beyond a liberator, She was a protector—first and foremost.  She happily allowed me to imitate whatever role I felt inclined to, masculine or feminine or both simultaneously, like a doting mother watching her child play.  But there were dark corners She never wanted me to discover.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p20">  
			At 15, my parents travelled a few hours south—over the Labor Day weekend of ’99—to move my sister into her college apartment in San Luis Obispo.  I finally have a chance to follow in my siblings’ footsteps, so I throw my first high-school adult-free party.  Hours into the first evening of the planned party weekend, I find myself barricaded in my parent’s room, with furniture shoved up against the door.  I listen, hopeful as my intoxicated friends struggle to push through for several minutes.  A thoughtful gesture, I suppose, but it is inevitably futile.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p21">   
			I had never seen my parents room from this angle—my head hanging over an edge of their bed—as he laid over top of me.  Every time I pushed back on his chest, struggling to squeeze out from under him, I continued saying no. “No, no, no... please?” I imagined I sounded like a squeaky mouse, because he wasn’t picking up my frequency.  I didn’t speak up though.   Maybe I should have spoken up, like my Grandpa frequently advised me: “In order to be taken seriously, Stephie, you need to speak up.”<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p22"> 
			Eventually, the “Nos” became a rhythmic chant stunning me into submission, as I meditated on the “nnn” and “ooo” reverberating through my chest and into the rest of my body.  He ordered me to wrap my legs around him.  I complied.  The remaining air fled my body, the tears slowly trickled down my cheeks, my “Nos” vanished under my shallow breath, as I obediently lay there.<br>  
		</div>
		<div class="p23"> 
			When I thought it was finally over, after he forced his seed in me—I’ve heard that Hell’s time moves by considerably slower—I eagerly awaited my freedom.  He wasn’t finished though.  He just needed rest.  So, he slept on top of me for the following five hours, the full weight of his frame exhausting me into a puddle.  I never slept that night.  Instead, I watched the digital neon numbers of my mother’s bedside clock slowly pass, stretching through time at a snail’s pace.  I examined the stark white walls, the fancy armoire, the silk ties hanging up in my father’s closet, the neatly organized rows of shoes—loafers, work boots, sneakers—and the floor safe.  I contemplated why adults needed safes.  What could they possibly need to put in such a safe place? Wasn’t their room safe enough? Their house? Do they make safes for people, for budding teenagers? <br>
		</div>
		<div class="p24"> 
			It wasn’t until he forced his seed in me a second time, upon waking up the following morning, that he was finally finished.  After I was allowed up—after he took the full weight of his 6’4,” 250lb frame off me—he turned to smile at me, as I lay frozen and naked on my mother’s side of the bed, crippled by terror.  I examined the chaos on my parent’s bed.  I studied a massive circle of blood, nearly covering the lower right quadrant of the mattress.  Immediately, I checked my body for gashes I didn’t know I had, but there were no open wounds to be found, except for, (whispering) down there—the source of the blood.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p25"> 
			After pulling on his pants and ratty t-shirt, he removed the furniture from in front of the bedroom door.  Downstairs, in the kitchen, he poured himself a glass of water.  Maybe I only imagined it, I’m not completely sure what I heard, but I could have sworn I heard a smacking sigh of relief as he finished and set the glass down.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p26"> 
			Hindsight is strange and, most of the time, enraging.  I wasn’t speaking loudly enough, I suppose, like my Grandfather lectured me about.  Then again, it was difficult to always take my Grandfather seriously.  He once showed me—when I still had curly pigtails and Rainbow Bright—this intriguing paper-folding trick using a one-dollar bill.  If done correctly, the finished product would read “Tits of America,” in place of “The United States of America.” He thought it was especially funny and appropriate.  Apparently, things like that qualified as becoming.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p27"> 
			My father never scolded me on speaking up.  I figured he had enough voice for us all.  But, he’s always told awesome stories.  Like the time he smoked a doobie with B.B. King.  Or how Carlos Santana was “hit” on my then-pregnant mother in the backstage area of a concert.  I figured it must be one of the way’s men compliment other men on “their” women.  Then there were his parables.  His favorite was retelling the time, when he was a young teenage man, that my Noni upset my Papa so much that he briefly left her. “She was such a prude, she wouldn’t put out for him, so he left her and slept in a motel until she did!” he would say, laughing.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p28"> 
			Sometimes that’s where he ends it.  Sometimes he goes on to say how he and his two brothers still laugh over it. “We always figured, she must have only had sex four, maybe five times in her life: once for each of her three kids, and at least once to get your Papa to come back home.” That is still one of his preferred stories.  I would prefer to be serenaded by a broken record.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p29"> 
			Apart from his stories, I would hear him use words in all sorts of ways.  I watched as he struck up lively conversations with random folks, moving his hands as if swatting away lingering fruit flies.  Certain words only came out when he was angry at others, or road-raging.  Bitch, whore, and slut were reserved for women—oftentimes this included my mother—but anyone could be a motherfucker.  Men were typically assholes, but I never heard him use a derogatory term for men who forced women to have sex with them.  I guess we implicitly knew this was a rapist, but there were no sexually-derogatory words for men in general.  And, really, any man or woman could be a rapist or a pedophile.<br>
		</div>
		<div class="p30"> 
			So, that settled it for a while.  I had no identifiers, beyond certain physical features, to attach to that man in my parent’s room.  Rapist seemed to make it too real.  I guess that’s where slut filled the vacuum-like hole left from that night, as I tried to reconcile what happened.  Not for him though, he remained nameless.  Words like bitch, whore, and slut were reserved only for women.
			<br><br>

			“So, tell me, son why do <em>you</em> choose that word?”</p>
